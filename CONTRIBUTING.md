## Reporting Potential Security Issues

If you have encountered a potential security vulnerability in Zend Framework,
please report it to us at [zf-security@zend.com](mailto:zf-security@zend.com).
We will work with you to verify the vulnerability and patch it.

When reporting issues, please provide the following information:

- Component(s) affected
- A description indicating how to reproduce the issue
- A summary of the security vulnerability and impact

We request that you contact us via the email address above and give the project
contributors a chance to resolve the vulnerability and issue a new release prior
to any public exposure; this helps protect Zend Framework users and provides
them with a chance to upgrade and/or update in order to protect their applications.
